  <h1>Privacy Policy for Tests</h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy outlines what data the <strong>"Tests"</strong> Discord bot ("the bot") collects and how that data may be used.</p>

  <h2>1. Data Collected</h2>
  <p>By using the bot, you acknowledge and agree that the bot <strong>may collect the IDs of all bots in any Discord server</strong> where it is present. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bot user IDs</li>
    <li>Guild (server) IDs</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No message content or personal user data is intentionally collected or stored.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
  <p>Collected data may be used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Core bot functionality</li>
    <li>Internal analytics or future features</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Data is not shared with third parties unless required by law.</p>

  <h2>3. Premium Features</h2>
  <p>The bot may offer premium or paid features in the future. Use of such features may result in additional data collection or require linking to payment platforms, which will have their own policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Data may be stored indefinitely or deleted at our discretion. We do not guarantee storage or deletion of any specific data.</p>

  <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
  <p>Since the bot does not store personal user data, no user-specific data removal requests are currently supported.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>There is no official support or contact channel available.</p>

  <h2>7. Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the bot indicates your acceptance of the latest version.</p>
