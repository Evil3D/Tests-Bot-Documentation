# Privacy Policy for Tests

This Privacy Policy outlines what data the "Tests" Discord bot ("the bot") collects and how that data may be used.

## 1. Data Collected

By using the bot, you acknowledge and agree that the bot **may collect the IDs of all bots in any Discord server where it is present**. This may include:

- Bot user IDs
- Guild (server) IDs

No message content or personal user data is intentionally collected or stored.

## 2. Use of Data

Collected data may be used for:
- Core bot functionality
- Internal analytics or future features

Data is not shared with third parties unless required by law.

## 3. Premium Features

The bot may offer premium or paid features in the future. Use of such features may result in additional data collection or require linking to payment platforms (e.g. Discord monetization, Patreon, etc.), which will have their own policies.

## 4. Data Retention

Data may be stored indefinitely or deleted at our discretion. We do not guarantee storage or deletion of any specific data.

## 5. User Rights

Since the bot does not store personal user data, no user-specific data removal requests are currently supported.

## 6. Contact

There is no official support or contact channel available.

## 7. Policy Changes

This policy may be updated at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the bot indicates your acceptance of the latest version.
